Common Causes and Fixes
‚úÖ 1. Gmail + App Passwords (if 2FA is enabled)

If your Google account has 2-Step Verification (2FA) enabled, your normal password won‚Äôt work for SMTP.
You must generate an App Password:

üîß How to generate an App Password (Gmail):

Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security

Under "Signing in to Google", make sure 2-Step Verification is ON.

Then click App passwords.

Select:

App: Mail

Device: Other (enter something like ‚ÄúSpring Boot‚Äù)

Google will give you a 16-character password ‚Äî use this instead of your Gmail password in application.yaml.

‚úÖ 2. Allow Less Secure Apps (only if 2FA is OFF)

If you do not have 2FA enabled:

Visit: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

Enable Access for less secure apps.

‚ö†Ô∏è Google is phasing out this option. App Passwords (above) are preferred and more secure.

‚úÖ 3. Check Gmail Activity and Unlock Captcha

Sometimes, Google blocks sign-in attempts from new locations or programs.

Go to: https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

Click Continue to allow access.

Then immediately try sending the email again from your Spring Boot app.

Confirm Access to App Passwords

Try visiting this direct link:

üîó https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

If it redirects you to the home page or says ‚ÄúThe setting is not available for your account‚Äù, then your account is restricted and you won‚Äôt be able to use Gmail SMTP directly.
